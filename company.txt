I completed my MCA in 2023 after graduating from Gujarat in 2021. Additionally, I completed a six-month internship as a software engineer. I gained knowledge of client interaction, business analysis, and certain related documents (BRD, FRS, SRD) and diagrams (Use case, ER, Activity) throughout this internship. I also use SQL, AI/ML, and Python (with libraries like pandas and numpy). I'm now learning powerBI, a tool utilized by many business analysts and data analysts. I'm eager to learn new business analysis-related technologies. I am interested in learning more about your CLM solution and joining a team that is expanding.
